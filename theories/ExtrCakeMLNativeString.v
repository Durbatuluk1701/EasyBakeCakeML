(* Other operations in module String (at the time of this writing):
      String.length
      String.get
      String.substring
      String.index
      String.findex
  They all use type "nat".  If we know that "nat" extracts
  to O | S of nat, we can provide CakeML implementations
  for these functions that work directly on CakeML's strings.
  However "nat" could be extracted to other CakeML types...
